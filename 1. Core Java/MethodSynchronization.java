// --------------------- METHOD AND BLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION ---------------------

// Threads communicate primarily by sharing access to fields and the objects reference fields refer to. This form of communication is extremely efficient, but makes two kinds of errors possible: thread interference and memory consistency errors. Some synchronization constructs are needed to prevent these errors

// 1. Method Synchronization
// Synchronized methods enables a simple strategy for preventing the thread interference and memory consistency errors. If a Object is visible to more than one threads, all reads or writes to that Objectâ€™s fields are done through the synchronized method.

// 2. Block Synchronization
// If we only need to execute some subsequent lines of code not all lines (instructions) of code within a method, then we should synchronize only block of the code within which required instructions are exists.

class Line
{
    // if multiple threads(trains) will try to access this unsynchronized method,they all will get it. So there is chance that Object's  state will be corrupted.
    public void getLine()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            System.out.println(i);
            try
            {
                Thread.sleep(400);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }
    }
}
  
class Train extends Thread
{
    // reference to Line's Object.
    Line line;
  
    Train(Line line)
    {
        this.line = line;
